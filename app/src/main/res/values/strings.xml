    <string name="tips_message"><b>Here are some tips on how to create a strong password that\'s difficult to crack.</b>\n\n
        - Your password should be <b>at least</b> 8 characters long. (16+ is recommended)\n\n
    - Your password should contain <b>lower case letters</b> (\"a b c\"), \n<b>upper case letters</b> (\"A B C\"), \n<b>numbers</b> (\"1 2 3\") and
        \n<b>special characters</b> (\". % &amp; @\")
    \n\n- <b>Never</b> use the exact same password on multiple accounts/websites. If one gets hacked, all the others may be in danger.
    \n\n- Your password <b>shouldn\'t</b> contain <b>words</b>, <b>phone numbers</b> or other things that are <b>associated with you</b>, since it makes
        guessing your password easier.
    \n\n- Replacing letters with numbers (e.g. the word \"<b>Password</b>\" to \"<b>P455w0rd</b>\") does <b>not make a password more secure</b>. The time it takes to crack
    it is almost the same.</string>
