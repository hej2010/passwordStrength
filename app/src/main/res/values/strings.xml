    <string name="tips_message"><b>Here are some tips on how to create a strong password that\'s difficult to crack:</b>\n\n
        - Your password should be at least 8 characters long. (16+ is recommended)\n\n
    - Your password should contain lower case letters (\"a b c\"), \nupper case letters (\"A B C\"), \nnumbers (\"1 2 3\") and
        \nspecial characters (\". % &amp; @\")
    \n\n- Never use the exact same password on multiple accounts/websites. If one gets hacked, all the others may be in danger.
    \n\n- Your password shouldn\'t contain words, phone numbers or other things that are associated with you, since it makes
        guessing your password easier.
    \n\n- Replacing letters with numbers (e.g. the word \"Password\" to \"P455w0rd\") does not make a password more secure. The time it takes to crack
    it is almost the same.</string>
